# What is Web Accessibility?

Web accessibility is a design and development approach that makes digital content and services accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities.

## Definition

Web accessibility means that websites, applications, and digital technologies are designed so that **everyone** can:

- Use them
- Understand them
- Navigate them
- Interact with them
- Contribute to their content

## Types of Disabilities Addressed

Web accessibility takes into account different types of disabilities:

- **Visual**: blindness, low vision, color blindness
- **Auditory**: deafness, hearing impairment
- **Motor**: mobility difficulties, paralysis
- **Cognitive**: dyslexia, attention deficit disorders, memory disorders
- **Neurological**: epilepsy, autism spectrum disorders

## Core Principles

Accessibility is based on four fundamental principles (POUR):

1. **Perceivable**: information must be presented in ways all users can perceive
2. **Operable**: interface must be usable by everyone
3. **Understandable**: information must be comprehensible to all
4. **Robust**: content must be compatible with current and future technologies
